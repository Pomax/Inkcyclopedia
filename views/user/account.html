      <h1>Your settings</h1>

      <p>There really aren't all that many settings, because it just doesn't make sense to need you to provide more details.</p>

      <p>The only meaningful thing right now is whether you want to be known by your uuid.v4 identifier, or by a more human
        readable alias. If you'd like an alias (and that can be your real name or a fake name, whatever you feel makes
        the most sense) just enter it into the alias box below, and if it's still available it'll be yours if you save your
        settings.</p>

      <p>If you already have an alias, it'll show up as placeholder text. Changing your alias after you picked one, however,
        is generally silly so try to just pick one you can live with, if you don't already have an alias that you use all
        over the internet.</p>

      <label>Set your alias to:</label>
      <input class="alias" type="text"<% if (!!user.alias) { %> placeholder="<%= user.alias %>"<% } %>>
      <button class="alias">make it happen</button>

      <div class="result hidden"></div>
