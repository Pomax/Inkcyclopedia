Inkcyclopedia
=============

A [tiny representation of the vast world of fountain pen inks](http://flickr.nihongoresources.com:1234/). Or -really- just "inks". Except Indian Black Ink, which is made with all manner of heavy pigments and ingredients that would destroy a fountain pen in pretty much less than a minute (that's not even a joke).

Why?
----

I was designing a typeface, and a colleague asked me "what does it look like when calligraphed?"

I had no response other than "No idea, let me by a fountain pen and get back to you". Then I bought several. Of course, none of the super expensive ones, but I do have some EF [Lamy Safari's](http://www.gouletpens.com/Lamy_Safari_Fountain_Pens_s/934.htm) (in matte black and laquer red, loaded with black and red ink) for doing drawing work, a 1.5 calligraphy nib Safari for -unsurprisingly- calligraphy, and a Sheaffer 100 (fine) for regular writing.

I also like writing in red, and while I started off with a Waterman Red, because it's easy and everyone carries it, I thought: "how many reds can there be?".

Turns out, [REALLY QUITE A LOT!](http://www.gouletpens.com/Shop_All_Bottled_Ink_s/1106.htm?searching=Y&sort=7&cat=1106&show=30&page=1&f-Red=1174)

So I bought a few reds, was unsatisfied, then discovered Goulet's "surprise me!" packs of 10 inks for $8.80 and went "I have a job. Give me eight of these". The exercise led to [this](http://imgur.com/gallery/5TGYc) and left me feeling like I didn't have a representational enough cross section of inks.

So I bought another ten packs, and ended up with 170 ink samples (if that doesn't quite math up, I also had some watercolour Talens Ecoline inks and two Indian Black Inks, which I threw in. The Ecolines are actually perfect for use with a Noodler's Konrad flex pen. If that means nothing to you: you're still safe).

I'm sorry...
------------

Don't worry, I'll recover. If anything, my handwriting is pretty damn fancy with all the writing I've been doing, and I discovered that I really like writing in Insular Majuscule (which you might know as "Gaelic fonts", except it's not really Gaelic but really much more Irish, and it's not a font, but a script, but that's neither here nor there)

However, if you're thinking of getting a fountain pen (and I won't lie, I have some $3 Platinum Preppy pens that work **just as well** for just quick writing as my $40 Shaeffer 100 so don't let the myth of "it's expensive" fool you: it really, *really* isn't) then finding an ink you like is going to be a stupid amount of work, if you don't just want "Parker Black" but something you actually like.

So basically I did this so you don't have to: 170 inks, probably more as time goes on, because this shouldn't be as horrible as it really is right now. Good luck finding a store with an open bottle of 200+ inks where you live.

So, what's the deal with this project/website?
----------------------------------------------

I'm still developing the Inkcyclopedia at the moment, so I'll first be going through my 170 inks and getting their images to look like the do "in real life". I have calibrated monitors (because photography) so it's mostly a matter of sitting down with the samples cut up into individual colours and matching the pixels to what I see on the paper on my desk.

Once that's done, I'll open up the floor to the rest of the world - because submitting a sample is stupidly simple. The Inkcyclopedia comes with a dedicate "submit a sample" page where all you have to do is drag your sample into the browser, and some cool JavaScript does color abstraction and the like, giving you what it thinks is the color of your sample, as well as some additional colours that it found that you can pick instead if it got the most important one wrong. You then just say which company's ink it is, and hit submit!

That's in fact exactly how I'm using it right now because I'm not going to hand-craft JSON objects and image data URIs, so I can confirm it works... and hopefully soon, for you.

License wise, this code is locked down. I know I usually release things in the public domain or as MIT, but I like this thing, I have spent money on it, and I'd like to maybe eventually turn it into a regular website instead of a side project. If I don't, the code will fall into the public domain. Until then: all rights reserved and (c) 2014 Pomax.
